## Malware Analysis Project 101: Building an Isolated Malware Analysis Lab (Self-Hosted)

This readme focuses on building a secure, self-hosted malware analysis lab using virtual machines. 

**Why a Malware Analysis Lab?**

A malware analysis lab provides a controlled environment to safely detonate and analyze malicious software. This allows you to:

* Understand how malware works
* Develop better security strategies
* Respond more effectively to security threats

**What You'll Learn:**

* Set up a virtual isolated network for malware analysis
* Install essential tools using a pre-configured virtual machine (Flair VM)
* Create snapshots to restore your environment after testing

**Building Your Lab:**

This guide will walk you through setting up a malware analysis lab using VirtualBox, a free and popular hypervisor software. 

**Software Requirements:**

* VirtualBox ([https://www.virtualbox.org/](https://www.virtualbox.org/))
* Flair VM (download link will be provided)
* Windows 10 Enterprise (free trial available) (download link may be provided)

**Steps:**

1. Download and install VirtualBox.
2. Download the Flair VM script and Windows 10 Enterprise (if download link not provided).
3. Create a new virtual machine for Windows 10 (Flair VM) with at least 2GB RAM and 75GB storage.
4. Install Windows 10 Enterprise on the Flair VM.
5. Install Google Chrome on the Flair VM.
6. Follow the Flair VM script instructions to disable security software and configure settings for safe malware execution.
7. Create a snapshot of the clean Windows 10 installation (this will be your starting point for each analysis).
8. Install additional security and analysis tools as needed using the pre-configured environment provided by Flair VM.
9. Configure a virtual network in VirtualBox to isolate the malware analysis environment from your main network.

**Additional Resources:**

* The Flair VM script will likely contain detailed instructions and any additional software downloads required.
* Search online for resources on malware analysis tools and techniques.

**Benefits of Self-Hosted Lab:**

* Free and easy to set up with readily available software.
* Offers more control over the environment and installed tools. 

**Remember:**

* Downloading malware can be risky. Only use safe sources for testing purposes.
* Malware analysis is a complex field. This guide provides a basic foundation, and further research is recommended.

By following these steps, you'll have a functional self-hosted malware analysis lab ready to explore the world of malicious software in a safe and controlled environment.
